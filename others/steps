1) Banking story you’re telling with WDI

Goal: “How macroeconomic conditions impact credit risk and lending strategy across countries/regions over time.”

You’ll answer:

Which countries are becoming riskier (inflation ↑, FX volatility ↑, GDP growth ↓)?

Where is consumer stress rising (unemployment ↑)?

Which regions show strong recovery (GDP ↑, inflation stabilizing)?

How do these signals change pre vs post shock (e.g., 2008, 2020)?

2) Pick 10–15 WDI indicators (bank-relevant)

Use these as your “macro risk factors”:

Growth

GDP growth (annual %)

GDP (current US$) (optional)

Inflation / Prices

Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)

Labor / Stress

Unemployment, total (% of labor force)

Rates / Credit conditions

Lending interest rate (%)

Deposit interest rate (%) (if available)

FX / External

Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average)

Current account balance (% of GDP)

Debt / Government risk

Central government debt (% of GDP) (if available in WDI)

Total reserves (includes gold, current US$) (optional)

Population (for per-capita normalization)

Population, total

That’s enough to build a realistic “risk dashboard”.

3) Data Warehouse design (Bronze–Silver–Gold)
Bronze (raw landing)

Table: bronze_wdi_raw

Keep it exactly as downloaded (including wide year columns if that’s how you get it).

Add metadata columns:

load_datetime

source = 'WorldBank WDI'

file_name

Silver (clean + standardized)

Table: silver_wdi_long
Convert wide → long:

Columns:

country_name

country_code

indicator_name

indicator_code

year

value

load_datetime

Cleaning rules:

Convert year to INT

Convert value to DECIMAL

Remove nulls where value is missing

Standardize country codes

Gold (banking analytics model)

Create a star schema:

Dimensions

dim_country (country_code, country_name, region, income_group)

dim_indicator (indicator_code, indicator_name, banking_category)

dim_date (year, decade, period buckets)

Facts

fact_macro (country_code, indicator_code, year, value)

Analytics marts (Gold+)

fact_macro_yoy (YoY change, rolling avg)

fact_risk_index (composite risk score per country-year)

4) Risk Index (the “bank-style” differentiator)

Build a simple composite score:

Example components (normalize each to 0–100 using percentile or z-score):

Inflation (higher = worse)

Unemployment (higher = worse)

GDP growth (lower = worse)

FX depreciation (higher = worse)

Risk Index = weighted sum

Inflation 30%

Unemployment 25%

GDP growth 25%

FX change 20%

This single metric makes your project look like a real bank risk dashboard.

5) Power BI dashboard layout (bank executive style)
Page 1 — Executive Macro Risk Overview

KPI Cards: Avg Risk Index, #Countries High Risk, GDP Growth Avg, Inflation Avg

Map: Risk Index by Country (color gradient)

Trend line: Risk Index over time (global + selected country)

Top/Bottom 10: countries by Risk Index

Page 2 — Country Risk Profile (Drillthrough)

Selected Country KPIs (Inflation, Unemployment, GDP growth, FX change)

4-line trend small multiples (each indicator over time)

“Risk Drivers” bar chart (which indicator contributes most)

Page 3 — Indicator Deep Dive

Slicer: choose indicator

Heatmap: country vs year (value)

Rank trend: top 10 countries for that indicator

Page 4 — Regional Comparison

Region slicer

Boxplot/Distribution (or percentile bar) by region

Trend lines by region (GDP, inflation, unemployment)

Page 5 — Shock Analysis (2008 / 2020)

Buttons/bookmarks: “2008 Crisis”, “COVID”

Before vs After comparison (avg values)

Countries most impacted (delta ranking)

6) What to write in your README (interview gold)

Include:

Business objective (bank macro monitoring)

Data source (World Bank WDI)

Architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold)

KPI definitions (Risk Index formula)

Dashboard screenshots
